Dengue is a mosquito borne disease which has became a trending epidemic across the world with huge losses of life. 

It has been reported actively in developing countries in the last decade and not all countries reporting dengue have the privilege of its cure. 

Dengue has affected many areas since the second world war owing to lack of hygiene and poor utilization and maintainence of water resources. 

The epidemic had major spread in South America and Asia making them primary stakeholders for great losses of lives and economic effort into the medical field for curing dengue.

If we make use of the data provided to us in order to forecast the number of cases caused by dengue based on historic statistics and environmental factors we can create a mitigative tool useful in that direction. Using Machine Learning and Data Mining, this project aims to design this mitigative tool and help give a deeper insight into predicting dengue and saving lives.
